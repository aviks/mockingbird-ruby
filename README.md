"To Mock A Mockingbird" combinators in Ruby 
============================================

To Mock a Mockingbird is a puzzle book by Raymond Smullyan which explains combinatory logic using a metphor of birds in a forest. The birds, which respond when called out to, are used as analogues to combinators.  

The code in this repository is an attempt to implement the definitions of combinator birds in Ruby, as an educational excercise. 

The book, after defining certain specific birds, provides puzzles to prove various theorems of combinatory logic, culminating in the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem. It should be obvious that this code makes no attempt to prove any such theorems. It merely implements the combinators, providing opportunities for learning and fun when combining them (pun intended). 

The code is structured according to the book, the idea being to follow alongside the chapters.
